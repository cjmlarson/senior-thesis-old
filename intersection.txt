1) spatial join all intersecting voronoi regions and census tracts
2) join back census track polygons
3) compute intersection of voronoi and census to create a new "overlap" polygons
4) convert overlap and census polygons to equal-area CRS
5) divide areas to find ratio of overlap
6) multiply by census population and sum for each airport
